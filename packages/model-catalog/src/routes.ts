// across providers (native ids are bare, e.g. `claude-sonnet-5`; OpenRouter's are vendor-prefixed,
// e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`; separators also differ, `-` vs `.`). Measured directly against
// the bundled `apps/cli/src/provider/catalog-manifest.json` (350 entries, reproduced by
// routes.manifest.test.ts against the live file): 290 route groups, 60 spanning more than one
// provider, 0 groups containing two entries from the SAME provider (the over-collapse a naive
// prefix-strip could cause — `mistralai/foo` must not collide with a native `openai::foo`, which
// is exactly why `vendor` is taken from the entry's OWN provider when its id has no slash, not
// derived by stripping a prefix unconditionally).
