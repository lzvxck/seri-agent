# SubagentStop hook — appends a timestamped entry to the active trajectory.md.
#
# Two bugs fixed here, both measured on 2026-08-06 against
# .claude/loops/abort-cancellation/trajectory.md — a loop that finished 2026-08-04:
#
#   total entries:              674
#   named "unknown-agent":      671
#   with a real agent name:       3   (written by hand by an orchestrator, not by this hook)
#
# 1. WRONG FILE. `find … -name trajectory.md | head -1` returns whichever path readdir
#    yields first, which has nothing to do with which loop is running. "abort-cancellation"
#    sorted first, so every subagent stop for two days appended there. Fixed by resolving
#    the loop from this session's own `session_id`.
#
# 2. NOTHING TO SAY. The old body read `$CLAUDE_SUBAGENT_NAME` and `$CLAUDE_SUBAGENT_STATUS`.
#    Those environment variables do not exist — Claude Code delivers hook input as JSON on
#    stdin, and this hook never read stdin at all. That is why 671 of 674 rows say
#    "unknown-agent"/"unknown". `.claude/rules/hooks.md` already carries this lesson for
#    block-dangerous, block-env-read and format-and-typecheck; log-trajectory was not on
#    that list and had the same defect. The real fields are `agent_type` and `agent_id`.
#
# Fixing only (1) would have produced 671 rows of noise in the correct file.
#
# 3. STILL 83-89% NOISE POST-FIX (found 2026-08-12, see
#    TRAJECTORY-UNKNOWN-AGENT-LOGGING.md). (2) only repaired named top-level `Agent`
#    dispatches. A dispatched agent's own internal work — nested Task calls, or
#    WebFetch/WebSearch-backed sub-steps it issues itself — fires its own SubagentStop
#    event with `agent_type` genuinely absent from the payload, not mis-parsed. Writing
#    "unknown-agent" for those rows carries zero information beyond a timestamp and an
#    opaque id, and crowded out the named rows that are actually informative (measured
#    83-89% of all subagent: lines across four loops). retro's own trigger table
#    (.claude/agents/retro.md) never keys on these rows — its evidence sources are gate
#    tables, `DECISION:` lines and quoted corrections — so skipping them loses nothing
#    it uses. Fixed by not appending an entry at all when `agent_type` is empty, instead
#    of defaulting to the string "unknown-agent".

# Backward compatibility: until the orchestrator writes SESSION files, fall back to the

# a session, write nothing: a guess here silently corrupts another run's audit log, which is
