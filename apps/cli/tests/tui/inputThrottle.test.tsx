// InputBox.tsx throttles its own repaints during a rapid keystroke burst (a held Backspace,
// which repeats at up to ~30 keystrokes/second) so the terminal isn't asked to redraw on every
// one of them, while never delaying a normally-paced keystroke and never submitting a stale
// pre-flush value on Enter. inputBox.test.tsx already covers the burst-coalescing and
// submit-uses-latest-value halves of that contract; this file keeps only the two scenarios it
// doesn't cover, to avoid asserting the same behavior twice: that a normally-paced keystroke is
// never throttled at all (no timer scheduled), and that a keystroke typed right after a submit
// gets its own immediate flush rather than inheriting a stale `lastFlushRef` from before Enter.
