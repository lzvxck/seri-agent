// Measures what a keystroke actually costs to write to the terminal, not what it costs to
// compute. `@opentui/core/testing`'s own `createTestRenderer` defaults to `bufferedOutput:
// "memory"` (frames kept in-memory only, for `captureCharFrame()`), which bypasses the exact
// diff-and-write path this file measures — passing a real `stdout` stream alongside an explicit
// `bufferedOutput: "stdout"` override makes the renderer allocate a real `NativeSpanFeed` and pipe
// actual diffed ANSI bytes through it (confirmed empirically against this exact harness: a plain
// `<text bg="#333333">` mount produces the real truecolor SGR on the provided stream), the same
// path `runTui`'s own real terminal mount uses.

  // full STRING lines on every frame, so a `theme.userBg` band that was accidentally
  // `TEST_COLUMNS`-wide (instead of message-width) cost real bytes on every single keystroke, not
  // just once. OpenTUI's renderer is a native CELL-level diffing buffer — a backspace in InputBox
  // only ever dirties the input row's own cells; the transcript's user-row band is never
  // re-examined by a keystroke at all, confirmed empirically against this exact harness (the raw
  // bytes captured during the backspace loop below contain no transcript-region content, styled or
  // not, regardless of `role`). There is consequently no per-keystroke cost left for a wide
  // user-band to inflate — the property worth guarding is now "editing the input box costs the
  // same regardless of the transcript's role mix," a stronger, renderer-appropriate form of the
  // same underlying concern. The band-WIDTH correctness itself (the fix this file originally
