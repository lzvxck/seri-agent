const DESCRIPTION =
  `Add, replace, or remove one line in one of seri's three persistent memory files: "user" ` +
  `(applies to every project), "memory-global" (cross-project environment facts), or ` +
  `"memory-project" (this repository only). Each file has a hard character cap; a write that would ` +
  `exceed it is refused and lists every current entry so you can consolidate with "replace" or ` +
  `"remove" instead. "target" identifies the entry to replace or remove — it must match exactly one ` +
  `existing entry. "reason" and "durable" are always required: they travel with the write for a ` +
  `human to review, never with the entry text itself.`;

// A factory, not a module-level const like provider/tools.ts's seven: the tool needs a per-dispatch
// configDir/worktree, which toolDefinitions' tools never do. Never added to toolDefinitions itself
// — it reaches exactly one ToolSet, the archivist's own, built directly in memory/archivist.ts's
// runArchivist rather than through subagents/roles.ts (the archivist is not a DISPATCHABLE_ROLE).
