// binary — so it throws "Could not find @vscode/ripgrep-<platform>" the instant seri is
// run from any directory other than this repo's own checkout. `rg-vendored.bin` (see
// vendorRipgrep.ts, run via `postinstall`) is a literal local file, so bun embeds its bytes
// directly into the compiled executable, CWD-independent. The embedded asset resolves to
