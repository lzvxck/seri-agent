// cached, deliberately: a long-running TUI session can outlive a PATH fix (Git Bash installed, or
// PATH corrected, without restarting seri) — caching "not found" too would make that recovery
// invisible for the rest of the process. Every other tool call in this codebase is either a single
// process (runBash's own cost is trivial there) or has no working alternative to retry towards, so
// re-scanning PATH on each failed call, rather than latching the failure, is the one case where the
// asymmetry is worth it: success is cached because it cannot un-become true, failure is not because
// it can.
//
// `find` is a seam, not a production knob: every real call site below omits it and gets the real
// findBash. A test proving the negative case recovers needs to simulate "not found anywhere"
