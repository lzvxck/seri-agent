// Explains a failed `edit` in two stages, tried in this order and for different failures.
//
// Stage 1 reuses the cascade's OWN matching model: `tryLineTrimmedMatch` (edit.ts:28-60) slides a
// window of oldString's length over the content and requires EVERY line to trim-match, so the
// natural way to describe a near miss is the window where the most lines trim-matched, and the
// first line inside it that did not. This is what makes the report point at the right line.
// Scoring oldString's first line alone would report line 1 whenever the model got line 1 right —
// precisely the dominant case, since tier 1 already trim-matches every line, so a failure arriving
// here with a correct first line means a LATER line differs. Measured on an implementation that
// did that: for a four-line oldString differing only on line 2, it named line 1 and printed the
// same string as both `actual` and `searched`.
//
// Stage 2 runs when no window qualified, and scores a single probe line by character similarity
// instead. Why it exists is argued at the branch itself.
//
// The two stages are floored DIFFERENTLY, and that asymmetry is the design rather than an
// oversight, because they rest on different kinds of evidence:
//
//   - Stage 1's evidence is POSITIONAL. The line it reports is corroborated by its neighbours
//     inside the window having matched. Character similarity is the wrong question to ask of it:
//     `stop();` vs `halt();` scores 0.429 as strings, but what makes it a near miss is that
//     `if (y) {` and `}` around it matched. Measured — flooring stage 1 on similarity rejected
//     that case and `log(err);` vs `report(err);` (0.500), both legitimate.
//   - Stage 2's evidence is ONLY the string. No neighbours, no corroboration, so a high character
//     floor is the entire thing keeping it honest.
//
// Pure, and deliberately so: it is called from `edit`, which takes the content as an argument and
// touches no disk (provider/tools.ts:106-114). At the failure site there is no path to read — the
// content came from the model's own tool-call arguments.

// Stage 2 only. See the asymmetry above for why stage 1 is not floored on this.
const MIN_SIMILARITY = 0.7;

// Whether a matched line is good enough evidence that THIS window is the right one. This is a
// solved problem in exactly this shape: it is the motivating example for **patience diff**, whose
// literature describes Myers diff aligning "any matching line, including very common ones, so
// moving a function in C can produce a noisy diff in which the closing brace of the moved function
// aligns with the closing brace of an unrelated function". That is our failure precisely.
//
// Patience's answer is UNIQUENESS — it anchors only on lines occurring exactly once — and both
// conditions below come from its own phrasing, "lines that are frequently non-unique, such as those
// containing a single brace":
//
//   1. Unique in the content. A line appearing many times is no evidence for any particular
//      window. This is the real rule, and it is the one a character test cannot express: `return;`
//      has identifiers and is worthless at 40 occurrences, while a `});` appearing exactly once is
//      genuinely informative.
//   2. Not punctuation-only. Uniqueness alone is not sufficient HERE, because patience compares two
//      files and needs a line unique in both, where we compare a short oldString against one file.
//      In small content the frequency statistic is meaningless — in the five-line case that
//      produced this bug, `}` occurs exactly once and would pass condition 1 on its own.
//
// Measured with condition 2 alone (a punctuation test, no uniqueness): a window anchored on a
// thrice-repeated `return;` reported `const a = 1;` as the near miss for
// `totallyDifferentThing();`. With condition 1 alone: the `});` repro returns.
