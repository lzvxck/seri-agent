// The process's one SIGINT/SIGTERM owner. Everything else that has to clean up on Ctrl-C
// registers a callback here instead of adding a listener of its own, because a second listener
// is work that never happens: the re-raise below kills the process where it stands. Measured in
// bun on Linux — the handler's first line runs, the line after process.kill(process.pid, signal)
// never does. Note that removeAllListeners is not what drops the second listener; emit iterates
// a clone of the array, so a listener registered later still runs in that same emit (measured:
// ran = ["first","second"]). The kill is what drops it, which is why this registry exists. The
// cancel branch further down does return without killing, but it runs no cleanups at all — the
// fatal press is the one this list is for.
//
// A cleanup that throws is contained rather than trusted not to, which is a deliberate exception
// to this repo's "no error handling for scenarios that cannot happen" rule: the one registrant
// (killInFlightChildren, in spawnCollect.ts) cannot throw today, but one that did would skip every
// later cleanup AND the re-raise, so removeAllListeners would never run and the signal death would
// surface as an uncaught exception with exit 1 — inverting the very 128 + n semantics this file
// exists to protect. A cleanup must still not depend on running before or after another, and that
// half is not enforced: the array is ordered by nothing more meaningful than module import order.
// One exception: `lastCleanup` (below) always runs after every entry here, because it restores the
// terminal's primary screen and has to run after Ink's own unmount, not before it.

// ran before Ink's own `instance.unmount()` (a `cleanups` entry), Ink's final frame would land on

// interface instead. Measured on a real pty with all three candidate handlers registered — rl's
// SIGINT and close fired, process.on("SIGINT") never did. That press has to spend the same single

  // The first press is not survival, it is an orderly death: cli.ts cancels the turn, lets it
  // unwind far enough to leave a resumable session, and then calls raiseSignal itself.
  //
  // SIGINT only, decided rather than inherited. Both signals reach this function, and letting a
  // SIGTERM take the cancel branch would silently change what `timeout 30 seri …`, a systemd stop
  // and a CI job canceller all get: they send SIGTERM once, expecting termination, and there is no
  // second press coming to convert into the fatal path. The unwind is bounded but not free — it
  // waits on whatever the in-flight tool does with its abort — so they would get a slower death and
  // nothing they can observe in exchange, since the resumable session an unwind leaves behind is a
  // Ctrl-C affordance for a human who intends to come back with --resume. So SIGTERM keeps the
  // behaviour it had before cancellation existed: cleanups, then die by signal.
