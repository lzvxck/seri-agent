//   - core.autocrlf: Git for Windows' installer sets this to `true` in the system config, so it is
//     on for most Windows users and on the windows-latest CI runner. Measured on this repo's
//     dev box: an LF file snapshotted and restored through `add -A` + `checkout-index -a -f` came
//     back as CRLF (2751a3a2… → 4ad3ef64…). Worse, the damage is selective — `checkout-index`
//     skips files whose stat still matches the index, so only the files that were actually edited
//     get mangled. It must be false at BOTH snapshot and restore time: with `true` at snapshot the
//     CRLF files are normalised to LF in the object database, so flipping it only at restore
//     corrupts the other direction. Measured caveat, so this is not read as stronger than it is:
//     with initShadow's `info/attributes` in place these three are belt to its braces — flipping
//     core.autocrlf back to true leaves every round trip byte-identical, because a path attribute
//     outranks config. They are what protects a store whose attributes file went missing.
//   - user.name / user.email: `commit-tree` refuses to run without an identity ("Please tell me
//     who you are"), and GitHub's runners have no global one. Supplying it per-invocation keeps
//     the shadow store from depending on the user's git identity at all.
//   - gc.auto=0: git's automatic gc would otherwise be free to fire in the middle of a tool call,
//     turning a ~100 ms snapshot into a multi-hundred-millisecond stall at random. Retention runs
//     `gc` explicitly instead, once per session, off the hot path.
