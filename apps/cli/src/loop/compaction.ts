// ever reached the user. Stated here because a spend question ("why three calls for one turn?")
// cannot be answered from a default that no line of this repo mentions. The delay is the SDK's and
// is not configurable through streamText: it honours a `retry-after-ms`/`retry-after` response
// header when that is shorter than its own backoff (dist/index.js:2718).
//
// It lives in this module, which is the lower of the two — loop.ts already imports compaction.ts,
// so the import goes the way that exists and no cycle is created. One constant rather than two
// equal literals in two files: what the number means is "the SDK's default, restated", and two

  // notifies from inside it. Measured with a doGenerate that 429s once then succeeds: two
  // doGenerate calls, one callback notification, two wrapGenerate invocations — the retry wrapper
  // re-invokes the model, so the wrapper around the model is the only place an attempt is visible.

  // I/O and its caller is a generator that cannot yield from a callback: the count travels out the

  // returning, so those attempts are not reported — that path reports the error itself.

  // reports no retries rather than growing a resolver for a caller that does not exist.
