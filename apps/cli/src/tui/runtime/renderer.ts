// previous tree's own effect cleanups; that tree's `useKeyboard`/`usePaste` listeners stay attached
// to the renderer's shared `keyInput` forever, alongside the new tree's own. Measured live over a
// real pty: past the welcome-splash -> main-TUI transition, a single physical PageDown fired
// app.tsx's own scroll handler twice — once from the live tree, once from the splash phase's own
// stale, disconnected `<App>` instance. The second firing dispatches into that stale instance's own
// abandoned `useReducer` state, whose render output no longer reaches the terminal (its host nodes
// were already removed when the live tree mounted), so this specific handler has no visible
// symptom today — but Ctrl-C's own handler (`renderer.keyInput.on("keypress", ...)` below) reaches
// OUTSIDE any one component's state into `signals.ts`'s module-level cancel slot, where a second,
// invisible-tree firing very much has a real, user-facing consequence (this is exactly the bug that
// registration used to have, before it moved off `<App>`'s own `useKeyboard` and down to here).
// `unmountBeforeRender` (below) closes the underlying duplicate-registration defect itself, for
// every handler a mounted tree happens to register, not just the one that currently has a visible
// symptom — so a future `useKeyboard`/`usePaste` addition that DOES reach outside its own
// component's state does not silently reacquire the same failure mode Ctrl-C already had.
