// literal character typed (`parse.keypress.js` sets `key.name = char`), with exactly one renamed
// exception — the space bar reports `name: "space"` even though it is printable — so
// `key.name.length === 1` (plus that one exception) is what a named/navigation key (`"up"`,
// `"pageup"`, `"escape"`, `"tab"`, every one of them multi-character) never satisfies. A Ctrl/Meta
// chord is excluded even when it otherwise looks single-character (e.g. Ctrl-A), and
// `key.sequence` — the real typed bytes/character, correct for non-ASCII input, not `key.name`'s
// normalised stand-in for cases like the space bar — is what a caller should append/compare.
